        <p>The Future of Jobs Report by the World Economic Forum has predicted 65% of children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that do not even exist yet.</p>
<p>The world is changing at such a fast pace that the high paying jobs of today did not even exist five years ago – and it’s hard to predict what kind of jobs we will be doing in another five years’ time. The reason for this big change? Software.</p>
<p>Now the question is how we prepare our kids for the future, there is only one answer to that question: Coding. Both parents and educators believe that in a country like India, where the education system grapples with lack of innovation, infrastructure, and archaic curriculum, coding is a well-structured way to introduce children to logical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Before the Industrial Revolution, fewer than 10% of schools taught mathematics, After the tipping point, every school introduced mathematics because that was the center of the revolution.</p>
<p>Coding skills are to us now what mathematics was to the Industrial Revolution: underrated at the time, but invaluable decades later. Now we are in the middle of the computer revolution, and it’s the same phenomenon: Schools need to realize the importance of coding as a skill.</p>
<p>For Chinese parents, teaching kids to code has become as important as teaching them maths and Chinese. In fact, many Chinese children are exposed to coding even before they enter pre-school. Now many Indian parents are also teaching children coding in pre-school.</p>
<p>In the next 5-10 years, it would not matter which school children attend schooling rather how digitally literate these children are, especially with the introduction of 5G technology which would be paradigm-shifting and would upend the traditional methods of Education.</p>
<p>If we do not introduce Coding in schools, then our children will be at a huge disadvantage and the future would be precarious.</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, most children learn to swipe and click before they can speak coherently or walk. Smartphones and tablets are their digital pacifiers, companions and entertainers. Kids do not need to be proficient in reading or writing to do this because stories and images are used to explain the concepts.</p>
